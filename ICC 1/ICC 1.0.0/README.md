# ISARIC Computationally Driven CRF Generation

Case Report Forms (CRF) are essential tools used in clinical research to collect and record data about individual study patients. These standardized templates are pivotal in capturing information related to various aspects of a clinical trial or research study, including demographics, medical history, lab results, vital signs, adverse events, treatment interventions, and more. 

ISARIC, a global network, is committed to utilizing CRFs in response to various outbreaks, allowing for customization to meet specific needs and requirements of individual countries, institutions, or research settings.
